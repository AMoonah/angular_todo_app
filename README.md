# Angularjs Seed
A basic angularjs setup - build with Grunt


## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navneetgarg-jahia/angular-seed.git
cd angular-seed

npm install -g bower grunt-cli

npm install
bower install
```

### Run

Just run ``grunt``. The default task cleans your build, rebuilds the project, starts the watch task and runs an http server!


## Whats Provided

* angularjs
* jquery
* boostrap
* grunt tasks

## Structure

```bash
├── Gruntfile.js
├── README.md
├── bower.json
├── package.json
└── src
    ├── assets
    │   ├── css
    │   ├── img
    │   └── js
    │       └── angularSeedModule.js
    └── index.html
```

Grunt will take care of the building of your project (i.e. concatenating/copying of files).
Everything ends up in the build directory - so just look there.
The rest is all up to you now!

## Thats it!
This is a barebones seed. Building an application out of this is entirely in your hands.

Check the [angular styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md) to make sure you're using the best practices & conventions!

Good luck on your angular adventures!
